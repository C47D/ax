## AX

This repository contains hardware and software for the AX5043 and
AX5243 radios from AxSemi (now ON Semiconductor). They are probably
the same die, but the AX5243 has fewer pins.

There is [hardware](hw/) for the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P. and a 2mm
pitch breakout board.

The [software](sw/) has both C and Python APIs, and can be used
without the cumbersome Ax-RadioLab GUI tool. Not all features of the
radio and supported yet.
